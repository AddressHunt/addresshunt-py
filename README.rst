Requirements
-----------------------------
addresshunt-py is tested against Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9, and PyPy3.6 and PyPy3.7.

Installation
------------------------------
To install from PyPI, simply use pip::

	pip install addresshunt


Usage
---------------------------------

Basic example

Autocomplete address

.. code:: python

	import addresshunt

    autocomplete_address = "11 NICHOLSON STREET"

    client = addresshunt.Client(api_key='') # Specify your personal API key
    address_list = client.autocomplete(autocomplete_address)

    print(address_list)

For convenience, all request performing module methods are wrapped inside the ``client`` class. This has the
disadvantage, that your IDE can't auto-show all positional and optional arguments for the
different methods. And there are a lot!



Dry run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Although errors in query creation should be handled quite decently, you can do a dry run to print the request and its parameters:

.. code:: python

    import addresshunt

    autocomplete_address = "11 NICHOLSON STREET"

    client = addresshunt.Client(api_key='') # Specify your personal API key
    address_list = client.autocomplete(autocomplete_address, dry_run='true')
